        "During my Internship at Norma Group I worked closely with the Director of Research and Development on a Flask, React Web application. I worked a lot on my own as I was the only Computer Science Focused employee working on the project. This Experience helped me realize what it takes to create and learn in an independent environment. The Internship also gave me a big boost in confidence as I finally was able to see how all my knowledge obtained at Michigan State University could be applied. It also gave me an Idea of how I could possibly create web applications as I found out how backend, frontend and Databases interact as well as how to host them on Microsoft Azure ",

        "During what was ultimately the most difficult semester of my life Emotionally, Physically, and therefore Mentally, I Turned to spending most of hours in the Capstone Lab working on the project. Which was another Web application that used Flask,React as well as a few new components such as Nexus Repository manager, Jenkins, PostgresSQL, and Docker. I learned about user Authentication, I learned alot about communicating between Operating systems and SDKâ€™s using Bash. I learned a lot as well from my partners in the project. All were very unique and gifted people in one way or another and taught me alot about Software Development as well as Life.",

I used /etc/hosts to block instagram and facebook on my laptop. '127.0.0.1  www.instagram.com' is how i did it. After I got started I created a sandbox tab. In the sandbox tab I followed along a youtube video about making a neon button in which I learned some very interesting things about 3d designing with CSS that i did not even know was possible. I also Redid the Topbar which is now named Navbar and the application today is much more friendly to different Sized Browsers, I also followed along a youtube tutorial to make a neon button and learned some of the 3d capabilities of CSS, I am excited to explore some more.",
